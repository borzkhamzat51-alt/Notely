Printed music notation continues to play a key role in both education and performance. However, physical scores and inconsistent publishing formats have long limited accessibility, searchability, and reuse. In recent years, large digital libraries like the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) have significantly improved access, offering hundreds of thousands of public-domain scores and recordings widely used by students and musicians. Projects such as the Sheet Music Consortium further enhance discoverability by combining metadata from different archives into unified collections.

Alongside these efforts, the adoption of open, machine-readable formats has advanced the digital preservation and exchange of music notation. MusicXML, maintained by the W3C Music Notation Community Group, has become the standard format for interoperability among notation tools, while the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) provides a richer framework for scholarly and archival uses.

About Notely

Notely is a web-based platform designed to simplify the access, organization, and management of sheet music for educational use. Instead of replicating large-scale digital libraries, Notely focuses on:

Secure and structured score management — including metadata such as composer, instrument, genre, and event.

API interoperability — built with a RESTful design compatible with standards like MusicXML and MEI.

Ease of deployment — suitable for classroom activities, usability testing, and future course extensions.

By keeping the feature set focused and standards-aligned, Notely bridges the gap between classroom requirements and the broader digital music ecosystem.
